We’re excited to share that our leadership team has published a paper in *PLOS Computational Biology*:

**[10 Simple Rules for Success in Computational Biology Outreach](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1013281)**

This article distills lessons learned from COMBO’s workshops, mentorship programs, and community partnerships into ten practical “rules” for building meaningful, sustainable outreach initiatives.

Key themes include:
- Designing accessible and engaging workshop materials
- Building strong community and school partnerships
- Supporting volunteers and leadership development
- Building an robust and efficiently functioning outreach organisation 

We hope this paper serves as a guide and inspiration for others working to broaden participation in computational biology.  

A huge thank-you to everyone in COMBO who has contributed to making these outreach efforts possible — this publication is a reflection of our collective work!
