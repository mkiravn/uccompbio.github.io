## Explore Our Workshops

We offer hands-on computational biology workshops designed to teach fundamental concepts in genetics and bioinformatics while introducing programming basics. Whether you're an elementary student just starting out or a high schooler diving into advanced topics, there's something for everyone! Here are a few of our most popular activities:

### üß¨ Genetic Code
**Audience**: Elementary/Middle School  
Learn about the process of DNA translation into proteins using basic Python coding notebooks. This workshop introduces concepts like the genetic code and provides an engaging way to explore how biology and computing intersect.

### üß† Introduction to GWAS
**Audience**: High School  
A computational workshop teaching the principles of complex traits and genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Students will learn about how genes are associated to traits via statistical analyses. This workshop also includes an introduction to Python grammar, syntax, and data visualization, using simulated genotype and phenotype data for hands-on practice.

### üå≥ Phylogenetics
**Audience**: Elementary/Middle School  
Explore the tree of life! In this workshop, students learn how to classify animals into the tree of life based on their characteristics and DNA. This interactive session introduces foundational concepts in evolution and phylogenetics.

### üè• Triage
**Audience**: Middle/High School  
Explore the tree of life! In this workshop, students learn how to classify animals into the tree of life based on their characteristics and DNA. This interactive session introduces foundational concepts in evolution and phylogenetics.
